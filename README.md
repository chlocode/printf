# Project Name: Custom Printf Function

### Project Description

This is a collaborative project on creating a custom printf function In C that mirrors the functionality of the 'printf' function in the standard library. Our function prints the '%' character and supports the following specifiers:
- %s
- %c
- %d
- %i

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- 'main.h': This contains the function prototype with include guards to prevent multiple definitions of the prototype.
- printf.c: This contains the implementation of our custom 'printf' function.
- README.md: This file contains the overview documentation of the repository,explaining the components of the project and its use.
